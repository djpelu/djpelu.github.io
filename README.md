this is where i try to build my website.  I'm new to GitHub, I'm new to website development (I made one with Wix and Velo, though), I'm totally new to html, css and javascrpt. Basically I don't know anything, but i can code a little with Python and R. Will this be useful? Time will tell. As for now I just discovered what an .md file is.
